> Hello World

I have had given a lot of thought before starting this website and I was quite unsure whether it makes sense.The first and foremost problem had was to find something to write about.

I work for a consulting company as Javascript developer where the technology/framework can change more faster than you change your attire.This does not mean that you will be always _Master of None_ if you are working in a consulting company.You have to learn and work on technologies that you love in your own time.I have tried to make use of my own time to learn new things and I have failed miserably in continuing it 😥.This website is one of many ventures to help me learn and share my knowledge.So

```javascript
function welcome() {
  console.log("Hello World")
}
```
