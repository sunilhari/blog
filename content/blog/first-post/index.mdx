> Hello World

I have had given a lot of thought before starting this website and I was quite unsure whether it makes sense.The first and the foremost problem I had was to find something to write about.

I work for a consulting company as a Javascript developer where the technology/framework can change more faster than you change your attire.This does not mean that you always remain _Master of None_.You always have to learn and work on technologies that you love in your own time.I have tried to make use of my own time to learn new things and I have failed miserably in continuing it 😥.This website is one of the many ventures to help me learn and share my knowledge.So

```javascript
function welcome() {
  console.log("Hello World")
}
```
